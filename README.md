# DynamicBatching

Run the program, ideally with RenderDoc, and press 'Space' to grow the grid of quads.
The first window will run without batching. Close it and the second window will appear that uses batching.

This is meant as an experiment with dynamically sizing batches for large collections of sprites that must be drawn.
It doesn't feature any textures or blending as of yet.
